      <p>Inspired by Calvin's popular Book Connection site from the early 2000's, the modern Calvin BookShelf is a website where students can take back control of their textbook purchasing from the textbook industry. At Calvin BookShelf, Calvin students can post their used textbooks for sale, available for fellow Calvin students to search for by title or by Calvin course. This enables students to connect directly with each other, avoiding the used book markups charged at the bookstore and shipping expenses charged at online booksellers. Calvin BookShelf offers the convenience and savings of buying directly from fellow classmates in the Calvin community.
