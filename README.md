What could you do with the money you’ve wasted on over charged textbooks? What if you could keep that money in your pocket by exchanging textbooks for what they’re worth, instead of buying them at huge markups and selling them back for 10% of what you paid?

Inspired by Calvin’s popular Book Connection site from the 2000 era, the modern Calvin BookShelf is a website where students can take back control of their textbook purchasing from the textbook industry. At Calvin BookShelf, Calvin students can post their used textbooks for sale, available for fellow Calvin students to search for by title or by Calvin course. This enables students to connect directly with each other, avoiding the used book markups charged at the bookstore and shipping expenses charged at online booksellers. Calvin BookShelf offers the convenience and savings of buying directly from fellow classmates in the Calvin community.
